# `moonutil`
A kinda smol collection of utilities for moonscript and lua

## Okay, but what's inside?
- some functions that would have deserved to be in the `string` and `table` modules
- a smol tuple library (new, len, get and set)
- rust-inspired composable iterators
- sets
- functional programming stuff, like function composition and operators as functions

## Why?
Out of spite, honestly

## What license is this under?
MIT
